    "Long long ago, the Kingdom of Xandelf, one of the mightiest kingdoms in all of West would accumulate its power through relentless conquest.",
    "The Emperor of Xandelf, the mighty but cruel Xerxeus knew no bounds and sought to conquer all of West to quench his thirst of blood...and glory.",
    "He adventured all across the 5 kingdoms of West, defeated mighty rulers and made harsh treaties, only to be stopped in his tracks by King Amethus.",
    "Amethus, the just king of Reclia, was one of the last hope of many who wished freedom from the tyranny of the king. And for many others, who wished a righteous ruler for themselves.",
    'Amethus was the only one of a select few who knew the secret of Xandelf and his mighty king...and the sole survivor of the said group of people...called the Keepers.',
    "Xerxeus was the only one who had broken into the Den of Keepers to claim the Demon vial for himself...the vial that gave the wielder the power of a demon.",
    "Amethus, however, had the Crystal vial, the only other artifact found so far to be able to defeat the Demon vial.",
    "The Battle of Reclia was the most bloody battle fought in the West. Mages threw blasts, knights pierced through walls of enemies, and Hunters popped enemies' eyes with their bows.",
    "In the end, Amethus was able to defeat the Demon King Xerxeus, but only by sacrificing himself in the process. It is said that their corpses intertwined to protect the vials the keepers held.",
    "And now...after a hundred years, the vials have been found again. It falls upon you...YOU, to find them and dispose them to rid the world of evils."
